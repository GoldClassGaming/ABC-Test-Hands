1: Change how decklists are stored so they're stored as .txt files in the Decklists folder and then imported into main.py with a function
2: Move all the code relating to combos to its own file and import it back into main.py so main.py is less cluttered
3: Add support for Card Attribute and Typing to make coding combos involving Galaxy Soldier easier
4: Add support for draw cards like Pot of Desires and Upstart Goblin
5: Add checks to see if key cards like Union Driver are still in the deck
6: TBD
7: More user friendliness
